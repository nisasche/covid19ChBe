# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Set current date as env variable
        run: echo "::set-env name=NOW::$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')"
      - name: Create File
        uses: "finnp/create-file-action@master"
        env:
            FILE_NAME: "lib/buildDate.js"
            FILE_DATA: "document.getElementById('updateTime').innerHTML = 'aktualisiert ' $NOW"
